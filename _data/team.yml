He also has a strange urge to genetically modify stuff. His keen interest in football is reflected in the way he idolises Lionel Messi and thoroughly enjoys classic rock and Led Zeppelin. There's definitely so much more to him than what meets the eye. Above all, the quality one would admire the most is how he'll always go out of his way to help someone. "
